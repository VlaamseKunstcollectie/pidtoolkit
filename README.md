pidtoolkit â€” generate PIDs for Flemish Museums
==============================================

## Description
pidtoolkit is a python toolkit for the generation of PIDs for museum objects, based on the current practice in Flemish museums. Extra fields are generated according to the practice in museums using Adlib via ErfgoedInZicht. These may not be necessary or relevant for other collection management systems.

**Note: the current version was created for use with the Flemish Art Collection's data and image aggregation infrastructure. As such naming and functionality reflects this.**

## Changelog
### v0.1b
- Split into multiple files
- Disabled representation redirects for CultURIze generation due to incompatibility with the Flemish Art Collection's IIIF infrastructure

### v0.1a
Initial version.
